# Hosting a Hackathon: another insufferable guide

As hackathons go, we were a mid sized event. And this experience taught the team a lot on what we did right, and what we didn't.

Hi I am Rishabh, and I like mangoes. Today I'm going to talk about my experience with hosting my first ever hackathon. Let's give y'all a little tour. Let's start with saying hello the logo of the event.

Say hello to our team! (I'm on the top right!)
