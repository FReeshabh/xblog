Oh hi, didn't see you there. I am here, you're here. Kind of rude I didn't
introduce myself, isn't it? I'm a computer science student at Texas Tech
University, and I pretend to be clever on the internet. It hasn't fooled anyone
yet, but a boy can dream. I like to learn new stuff.

If you want to find me, call on to Cthullu. If Cthullu doesn't answer, an email
is acceptable too [rishabhtewari1@gmail.com](mailto:rishabhtewari1@gmail.com)
